# Overview
This project's goal was the create a website that allowed users to view and filter a dataset about UFO encounters.

# Results
This webiste has multiple filters along the left side of the page. To begin filtering, simply choose a field and type. After typing, results will be displayed to the right of the filters. This is shown in the image below.

To add additional filters, simply begin typing in another field. Once you finish typing, a narrower list of results will appear.

# Summary
- A downside of this is the lack of clear "Filter" buttons or a "Clear Filters" button. Those are common in other filtering designs and would be useful here too.

- However, This could be improved by adding both a "Filter" and/or "Clear Filters" buttons. Also increasing the dataset size that is being filtered. Currently it only has 2 weeks of data. The more data added, the richer the search. Lastly, having some additional articles talking about different findings. And finding articles that you could link a result to so the client could learn more about a filtered result.
